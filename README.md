## Introduction
- Our products provide a solid and comprehensive foundation of expertise in the electronics field.
- We are proud to fully meet the design requirements for differential OTL power amplifier circuits.
- The product is composed of three main layers: differential layer, boost layer, and power layer.
- Each layer is calculated in detail, undertaking separate functions, contributing to creating a complete and effective product.
## How the System Works
### System Overview:
- Differential OTL (Output Transformer-Less) power amplifier is a type of amplifier designed to amplify electrical signals without using an output transformer. 
- This helps reduce the size, weight and cost of the system.
